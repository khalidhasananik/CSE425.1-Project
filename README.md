# Code Efficiency through Intermediate Code Optimization

This project aims to develop a simple programming language compiler with a primary focus on intermediate code optimization using the LLVM compiler infrastructure. The goal is to implement various optimization techniques at different levels, including local, global, and inter-procedural optimization, to significantly improve code efficiency.
