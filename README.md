# Code Efficiency through Intermediate Code Optimization

Welcome to our project! This repository explores various compiler optimizations to enhance C++ program performance. It includes scripts for generating IR, applying optimizations, and measuring execution times.

## Prerequisites

- LLVM
- CLANG
- G++

If you are struggling to install these tools, follow my [article](<https://medium.com/@khalid.hasan1/a-beginners-guide-to-installing-compiler-tools-llvm-flex-bison-on-windows-c79374a0c108>).

Here, I have made a step-by-step guide on how to install these tools.

## How to Run the Code

Follow these steps to get your programming language up and running:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khalidhasananik/CSE425.1-Project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd /PATH-TO/CSE425.1-Project
   ```

3. **Compile the Code:**
4. 
   ```bash
    chmod +x optimize_and_measure.sh
   ./optimize_and_measure.sh
   ```
It will take some time to compile.

Happy coding ðŸš€
